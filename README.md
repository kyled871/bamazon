# bamazon

## Instructions:
- When `node` runs the `bamazonCustomer.js` file, the user will be shown the available items in the corresponding MySQL database.
- The user can then choose the desired item by the **Item ID** and can select the appropriate quantity.
- If the user or the qty is invalid they will get an error message and another try to input their order.
- If the user's order is successful they will receive a success message along with the choice to place another order or exit. The quantity chosen will be subtracted from the databases amount.
